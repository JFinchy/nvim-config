# nvim config

Built off of lazy.nvim.

I might come back to this someday but currently setting aside due to issues with [Typescript](https://github.com/jose-elias-alvarez/typescript.nvim/issues/80) that for me made it hard to see type info and work within nvim. This may not be the case for all but I went into this being realistic with myself that I was not someone who would dedicate a large amount of time in nvim config. I enjoy out of the box solutions for things in my setup and don't want to work to hard on things like getting Typescript working properly.

This may change with the work typescript-tools is doing and I hope it does. Til then I look forward to continue using vim motions within vscode and utilizing extensions for vscode like leap. Eventualy I think I'll throw my different vscode settings and profiles up here instead but we'll see ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

More and more people seem to be using vim within vscode like Melkey who made an interesting video where he shares his own settings.
